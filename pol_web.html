            <h2>Pol Recasens - UI</h2>

            <h4>My Work </h4>
            <p>
              As a UI responsible, I’ve implemented the bases of the UI System. The UI system that I’ve designed works with a list of UI elements that are loaded from a xml file. Every element is controller by its father item. To paint these elements the code goes through the list, traveling from the children to the parents. The base UI elements are:


            </p>
            <h4>Image </h4>
            <p>
              This is the most basic element of the UI. Different elements of the UI are composed by images. An image is a section of the UI atlas texture.
            </p>
             <cite><img  src="img/fotos web pol/image.png" alt="marche"></cite>
            <h4>Label</h4>
            <p>
              The Label element is composed by a text, font and colour. Also, it can change during
the game, so I’ve implemented a function that allows to change the text and colour at
any moment. This is important in texts that you need to update constantly, like the
amount of gold. Also, for the dialogue system I've implemented a function that allow
the text to appear progressively, like a typewriter.
            </p>

            <h4>Button</h4>
            <p>
              The Button element is a little more complicated. It’s composed by three different
              states: idle, hover and click. Depending on his states, it will be printed with a concise
              image. It also has an intrinsic function, that will be executed when the button is
              pressed.
            </p>
<cite><img  src="img/fotos web pol/buttons.png" alt="marche"></cite>
            <h4>Sliders</h4>
            <p>
              The slider element is used to regulate the audio and FX volume. It has an internal
function that allows to calculate slider value depending on the thumb. It can also be
used to slide texts.
            </p>

            <h4>Checkbox</h4>
            <p>
              The checkbox element is very similar to the button element. It’s is composed by the
same three states, and it has an intrinsic function that will be executed once the
checkbox is clicked.
            </p>

            <h4>Inventory - Shop</h4>
            <p>
              This element is the most complicated element of the UI. It has several functions that
allows you to equip an item, buy or sell an item, swap the inventory to check other
slots and a large etcetera. It is composed by different images. The first is the
background, then, all the loot is placed inside every box. You can also swap the player,
to see his equipped objects.
            </p>

            <h4>Experience Bar</h4>
            <p>
              The Experience Bar is a variant of the Health Bar. It shows how many experience has
the player and it updates every time the player gain experience.
            </p>

            <h4>Load from XML file</h4>
            <p>
              All the UI elements are loaded from a xml file, to simplify it. This facilitates the creation
of an element at any time of the game development. All the data follows a children
and parent method:
